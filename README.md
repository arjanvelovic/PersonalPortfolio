## Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the code repository for my personal portfolio website. This sleek frontend application showcases my work and skills using the latest features of React.

### Technologies Used

- TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved code quality and maintainability.
- HTML: Markup language for creating web pages.

2. Modify colors by replacing all instances of "green" with your desired color.
3. Upload a logo, preferably both light and dark versions.
4. Add a background image.
5. Upload a picture of yourself.
6. Provide pictures for your projects.
