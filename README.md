This is the code for my personal portfolio

This is a sleek front end application which uses the latest React features.
The application was built with the use of React, Typescript, HTML, Tailwind, and CSS

This react application is completly custimizable by editing the information in the PortolioInfo.tsx file in src/assets/

To fully costumize the porfoliopage to a specific user you must:
- edit the PortolioInfo.tsx document
- change color by changing all "green" to a desired color (use Ctrl+Shift+H)
- upload a logo, preferably a light and dark version
- upload a background image
- upload a picture of yourself
- upload pictures for your projects
- upload a picture of your resume
- upload a pdf of your resume
